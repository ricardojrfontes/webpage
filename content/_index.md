  I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Economics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I hold an M.A. in Economics from Fundação Getúlio Vargas - Brazilian School of Economics and Finance (EPGE/FGV-RJ), located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and a B.A. in Economics from the University of São Paulo, in São Paulo, Brazil.
    
  My research interests span several areas within applied microeconomics, with a particular focus on Environmental, Energy, and Agricultural Economics, Industrial Organization, Econometrics, and Finance.
    
  Feel free to explore my C.V. and reach out via the contact information provided below.
